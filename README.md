## General Information

This is an experimental build of Rockbox.

Most of the work was already done by the original Rockbox team - all credits to them.

I mostly added quick hacks to make this usable on a device without any touch inputs.

Do NOT run this if you don't know what you are doing. You might brick your device in the process of installing this app. You have been warned.

## 240p vs 360p Releases

The Innioasis Y1 has a 480x360px screen. Most Rockbox themes were developed for devices with a resolution of 320x240px screens. Those themes usually do not work on a 360p Rockbox Android build.

Therefore there are 2 versions of this Rockbox port:

### 360p Rockbox
**Pros**:

- crisp high-resolution and minimalist Rockbox experience
- included, ready to go, Light and Dark Theme (modified versions of MacClassic https://themes.rockbox.org/index.php?themeid=3104)

**Cons**:

- Themes built for other devices usually don't work

### 240p Rockbox
**Pros**:

- huge themes backlog (roughly 2/3 of themes here seem to work: https://themes.rockbox.org/index.php?target=ipod6g)

**Cons**:

- lower resolution (1/3 smaller than 360p - images might be blurry, fonts can look a bit off)

## Installation
### Y1 Helper (recommended for Windows)

Install the most recent release of the Y1 Helper application and follow the instructions to install Rockbox: https://github.com/team-slide/Y1-helper/releases/latest

### SPFlash Tool (recommended for Linux)

1. Download the latest Rockbox included firmware here (the RAR archive, not the ZIP): https://github.com/team-slide/project-gallagher/releases/latest
2. Unpack the archive
3. Install SP Flash Tool v5.1904:
  - Windows: included in the archive, alternatively: https://spflashtools.com/windows/sp-flash-tool-v5-1904
  - Linux: https://spflashtools.com/linux/sp-flash-tool-v5-1904-for-linux
4. Start SP Flash Tool
5. Follow the official firmware flashing instructions but use the MT6572_Android_scatter.txt from the Project Gallagher archive

### Manual installation (for developers)

If, despite all warnings, you still want to try installing it manually you need to do the following:

- have an Innioasis Y1 with ADB enabled
- root the device (see https://xdaforums.com/t/root-framaroot-a-one-click-apk-to-root-some-devices.2130276/):
```
adb install Framaroot-1.9.3.apk
adb shell monkey -p com.alephzain.framaroot -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
# wait for it to start
adb shell input DPAD_DOWN
adb shell input DPAD_CENTER
# wait for the success message
```
- Reboot device
```
adb reboot
```
- Update keymap file to be able to navigate systems menus
```
adb shell mount -o rw,remount /system
adb pull /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl Generic.kl
cp Generic.kl Generic.kl_backup
sed -i '/key 103   DPAD_UP/c\key 105   DPAD_UP' Generic.kl
sed -i '/key 108   DPAD_DOWN/c\key 106   DPAD_DOWN' Generic.kl
sed -i '/key 105   DPAD_LEFT/c\key 103   MEDIA_PREVIOUS' Generic.kl
sed -i '/key 106   DPAD_RIGHT/c\key 108   MEDIA_NEXT' Generic.kl
sed -i '/key 163   MEDIA_NEXT/c\key 163   DPAD_RIGHT' Generic.kl
sed -i '/key 165   MEDIA_PREV/c\key 165   DPAD_LEFT' Generic.kl
adb push Generic.kl /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl
adb shell chmod 644 /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl
adb reboot
```
- Download the latest Rockbox release APK from the sidebar
- Download the latest Rockbox libs.zip and unzip it such that there is a folder called `libs/armeabi`
- Either use one of the preinstalled themes or supply your own in the .rockbox folder on the SD card
- Uninstall any apps you do not want
```
# list packages
adb shell pm list packages
# uninstall package
adb uninstall <package>
# or if that fails
adb shell pm disable-user <package>
```
- Install rockbox as system app:
```
adb remount
adb push rockbox-[240p/360p]-[release].apk /system/app/org.rockbox.apk
adb shell chmod 644 /system/app/org.rockbox.apk
adb shell chown root:root /system/app/org.rockbox.apk
adb push libs/armeabi/librockbox.so /system/lib/
adb shell chmod 644 /system/lib/librockbox.so
adb shell chown root:root /system/lib/librockbox.so
adb shell rm -rf /data/data/org.rockbox/lib
adb shell mkdir /data/data/org.rockbox/lib
adb push libs/armeabi/* /data/data/org.rockbox/lib/.
```
- Restart the device, choose Rockbox as launcher when asked
```
adb reboot
```

**First start might take up to 10s or even display an error about reading the SD card:**

- That's not a problem and should only happen once
- Restart Rockbox when in doubt via `Main Menu > System > Restart Rockbox (last option in list)`
